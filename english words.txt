    "Understanding the critical angle:\n\nAngle of Attack (AoA):\n• Angle between wing chord and airflow\n• Increasing AoA increases lift... to a point\n• Critical angle: typically 15-20 degrees\n• Beyond critical angle: stall occurs\n\nStall Characteristics:\n• Airflow separates from wing surface\n• Sudden loss of lift\n• Increase in drag\n• Aircraft begins to descend\n• Recoverable by reducing AoA\n\nStall Prevention:\n• Maintain adequate airspeed\n• Avoid excessive pitch angles\n• Use stall warning systems\n• Practice stall recovery procedures\n• Wing design features (vortex generators, slots)",

    "Electric Vehicles",
    "Electric vehicles use electromagnetic principles:\n\nBasic Operation:\n• Battery provides DC electricity\n• Inverter converts DC to AC\n• AC powers the electric motor\n• Magnetic fields create rotation\n• Direct drive to wheels (no transmission needed)\n\nAdvantages:\n• Instant torque delivery\n• 90%+ efficiency (vs 30% for gas engines)\n• Fewer moving parts\n• Regenerative braking recovers energy",
    "Forced induction increases engine power:\n\nTurbocharger:\n• Uses exhaust gases to spin a turbine\n• Compresses intake air for more oxygen\n• Increases power without increasing engine size\n\nSupercharger:\n• Belt-driven by the engine\n• Provides instant boost with no lag\n• Uses some engine power to operate\n• Common in high-performance vehicles",
    "The four-stroke cycle is the foundation of most car engines:\n\n1. Intake Stroke: Piston moves down, intake valve opens, air-fuel mixture enters\n2. Compression Stroke: Both valves close, piston moves up, compressing the mixture\n3. Power Stroke: Spark plug ignites mixture, explosion pushes piston down\n4. Exhaust Stroke: Exhaust valve opens, piston moves up, pushing out burnt gases\n\nThis cycle repeats thousands of times per minute in your engine!",
    "Aerodynamic efficiency is crucial for performance and efficiency:\n\nDrag Force Formula: Fd = ½ × ρ × v² × Cd × A\n\nWhere:\n• ρ (rho) = air density\n• v = velocity\n• Cd = drag coefficient\n• A = frontal area\n\nTypical Cd Values:\n• Modern sedan: 0.25-0.30\n• SUV: 0.30-0.35\n• Sports car: 0.28-0.32\n• Hypercar: 0.25-0.28\n\nLower Cd = better fuel economy and higher top speed.",
    "Key components that make your engine work:\n\n• Pistons: Convert combustion pressure into mechanical motion\n• Crankshaft: Converts piston motion into rotational motion\n• Camshaft: Controls valve timing for optimal performance\n• Valves: Control air intake and exhaust flow\n• Spark Plugs: Ignite the air-fuel mixture\n• Fuel Injectors: Precisely deliver fuel to cylinders\n\nModern engines use advanced materials and computer control for efficiency.",
    "Managing heat is critical for performance:\n\nCooling Systems:\n• Radiator: Cools engine coolant\n• Intercooler: Cools compressed air (turbos)\n• Brake cooling ducts: Prevents brake fade\n• Oil coolers: Maintains oil temperature\n\nAirflow Management:\n• Grille shutters: Close at speed for efficiency\n• Hood vents: Extract hot air from engine bay\n• Wheel well vents: Reduce turbulence\n• Underbody panels: Smooth airflow underneath",
    "Getting power to the wheels:\n\nManual Transmission:\n• Driver controls gear selection\n• Most engaging driving experience\n• Typically more efficient\n• Becoming rare in new cars\n\nAutomatic Transmission:\n• Torque converter or dual-clutch\n• Smooth, convenient operation\n• Modern autos are very efficient\n• Can shift faster than humans\n\nCVT (Continuously Variable):\n• No fixed gears, infinite ratios\n• Optimal efficiency\n• Can feel unusual to drive\n• Common in hybrid vehicles",
    "EVs recover energy when slowing down:\n\nHow It Works:\n1. Driver releases accelerator or brakes\n2. Motor becomes a generator\n3. Kinetic energy converts to electricity\n4. Battery stores recovered energy\n5. Can recover 60-70% of braking energy\n\nBenefits:\n• Extended range (10-25% improvement)\n• Reduced brake wear\n• Smoother driving experience\n• One-pedal driving capability"
