## 🎯 What Still Needs to Be Done

### 1. **Visual Level Headers on Maps**
Add prominent level transition markers showing:
- 🟢 BEGINNER LEVEL - "Build foundation — how it works"
- 🟡 INTERMEDIATE LEVEL - "Learn systems and physics"
- 🔵 ADVANCED LEVEL - "Design, simulate, analyze"
- 🔴 MASTER LEVEL - "Innovate and optimize"

These should appear at the start of each level section on all three journey maps.

### 2. **Update Aerospace Journey**
- Implement the 83-lesson structure with proper unit organization
- Create generator similar to automotive and rocket
- Update GameMapPlanes to show correct lesson counts

### 3. **Quiz System Enhancement**
Implement different quiz types per level:
- 🟢 Beginner: Visual Recognition + Concept Match
- 🟡 Intermediate: Interactive Calculations + Diagrams
- 🔵 Advanced: Simulation & Troubleshooting
- 🔴 Master: Design Decision + Optimization

### 4. **Progress Tracking**
- XP system (+10 per quiz, +50 per unit completion)
- Streak bonuses (+5% XP per day of consistent learning)
- Achievement system (Bronze, Silver, Gold medals per unit)
- Leaderboard ("Top 1% Learner" rankings)

### 5. **Lock/Unlock System**
- Beginner → Intermediate: Unlock after passing 80% of quizzes
- Progressive unlocking through levels
- Visual indicators for locked/unlocked content
