# 🚀 Curriculum Implementation Plan

## Current Status
✅ **Completed**: Level 1, Unit 4 - Basics of Flight (6 lessons + 6 quizzes)
- Interactive lesson pages
- 5 quiz question types
- XP/Progress system integrated
- Database schema ready

---

## 📋 Implementation Strategy

### Option A: Incremental Build (Recommended)
Build one unit at a time, test, and deploy. Users get new content regularly.

**Pros:**
- Manageable workload
- Can test and iterate
- Users see progress
- Revenue can start earlier

**Cons:**
- Takes longer to complete
- Need to maintain momentum

### Option B: Bulk Content Creation
Create all content first, then implement.

**Pros:**
- Consistent quality
- Complete curriculum at launch
- Better planning

**Cons:**
- Massive upfront work (211 lessons!)
- No user feedback until done
- Risk of burnout

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Content Creation Workflow

#### 1. Lesson Template Structure
```javascript
{
  id: number,
  title: string,
  level: "Beginner" | "Intermediate" | "Advanced" | "Expert" | "Master",
  unit: string,
  unitNumber: number,
  lessonNumber: number,
  duration: string,
  emoji: string,
  xpReward: number,
  
  content: {
    introduction: string,
    sections: [
      {
        title: string,
        content: string,
        images?: string[],
        interactive?: Component
      }
    ],
    keyTakeaways: string[],
    vocabulary: [
      { term: string, definition: string }
    ]
  },
  
  quiz: {
    questions: [
      {
        type: "multiple-choice" | "true-false" | "calculation" | "diagram-label" | "drag-drop",
        question: string,
        options?: string[],
        correctAnswer: any,
        explanation: string,
        points: number
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### 2. Database Schema Updates
Already have:
- ✅ user_progress
- ✅ quiz_results
- ✅ user_xp
- ✅ user_badges

Need to add:
- `lessons` table (store all lesson metadata)
- `units` table (organize lessons)
- `user_lesson_progress` (track time spent, completion)

#### 3. UI Components Needed
- ✅ Lesson page template
- ✅ Quiz page template
- ✅ 5 quiz question types
- ✅ Progress display
- ✅ XP system
- 🔲 Unit overview page
- 🔲 Level selection page
- 🔲 Certificate generator
- 🔲 Interactive diagrams library
