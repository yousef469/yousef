# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document defines the requirements for implementing a B2C premium subscription system for an engineering education platform. The system follows a freemium model similar to Duolingo Plus, offering three tiers: Free, Pro ($12/month or $99/year), and Master ($199/year). The subscription system enables monetization while providing value through unlimited AI tutoring, full lesson access, offline mode, 3D model access, and future VR/AR support.

## Glossary

- **Subscription_System**: The software component that manages user subscription tiers, payment processing, and feature access control
- **User_Account**: A registered user profile with authentication credentials and subscription status
- **Subscription_Tier**: The level of service (Free, Pro, or Master) associated with a user account
- **AI_Chat_Quota**: The maximum number of AI tutor interactions allowed per time period for a subscription tier
- **Payment_Provider**: External service (e.g., Stripe) that processes subscription payments
- **Feature_Gate**: Access control mechanism that restricts features based on subscription tier
- **Offline_Mode**: Capability to access lessons and content without internet connectivity
- **Certificate_System**: Component that generates and manages completion certificates for Master tier users
