# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for diagnosing and fixing Vercel deployment issues that occurred after adding the compare section to the AeroAI 3D application. The application builds successfully locally but fails to deploy properly to Vercel.

## Glossary

- **Vercel**: Cloud platform for static sites and serverless functions
- **Build Process**: The compilation and bundling of source code into production-ready assets
- **ComparePage**: A React component that allows users to compare different 3D models side-by-side
- **Deployment**: The process of making the application available on Vercel's hosting infrastructure
- **Environment Variables**: Configuration values stored separately from code (e.g., API keys)

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Identify Deployment Failure Root Cause

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify why Vercel deployment fails after adding the compare section, so that I can fix the issue and deploy successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the developer reviews Vercel deployment logs, THE System SHALL display any build errors or warnings
2. WHEN the developer checks the build output, THE System SHALL confirm whether the build completes successfully
3. WHEN the developer examines the ComparePage component, THE System SHALL identify any missing dependencies or import errors
4. WHEN the developer reviews routing configuration, THE System SHALL verify that all routes are properly configured

### Requirement 2: Fix Build Configuration Issues

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure the build configuration is correct, so that Vercel can successfully build and deploy the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Vercel attempts to build the application, THE Build Process SHALL complete without errors
2. WHEN the build process runs, THE System SHALL properly bundle all dependencies including Three.js and React components
3. WHEN environment variables are required, THE System SHALL access them correctly during build time
4. WHEN the build completes, THE System SHALL generate all necessary static assets in the dist folder

### Requirement 3: Resolve Route and Component Issues

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure all routes and components work correctly, so that users can access the compare page without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to /compare route, THE Application SHALL render the ComparePage component without errors
2. WHEN ComparePage loads, THE System SHALL properly initialize all 3D viewers and comparison data
3. WHEN the application uses protected routes, THE System SHALL correctly handle authentication state
4. WHEN components are imported, THE System SHALL resolve all module dependencies correctly

### Requirement 4: Verify Deployment Success

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify that the deployment is successful, so that users can access the updated application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the deployment completes, THE System SHALL be accessible at the Vercel URL
2. WHEN a user visits the deployed site, THE Application SHALL load without console errors
3. WHEN a user navigates to the compare page, THE ComparePage SHALL render correctly with all features functional
4. WHEN the application loads, THE System SHALL display the correct version number and features
