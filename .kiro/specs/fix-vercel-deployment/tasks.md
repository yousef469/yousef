# Implementation Plan

- [ ] 1. Verify local build and identify issues
  - Run `npm run build` to confirm local build succeeds
  - Check for any warnings or errors in build output
  - Verify dist folder is generated correctly with all assets
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 2.1_

- [ ] 2. Check Git and GitHub status
  - Verify all changes are committed with `git status`
  - Confirm changes are pushed to GitHub remote
  - Check GitHub repository shows latest commits
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 4.1_

- [ ] 3. Review Vercel deployment configuration
  - Check Vercel dashboard for deployment status and logs
  - Verify environment variables are set correctly in Vercel
  - Confirm build command and output directory settings
  - Check if GitHub integration is properly connected
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.3, 4.1_

- [ ] 4. Analyze ComparePage component dependencies
  - Review all imports in ComparePage.jsx
  - Verify ThreeJSViewer component is properly imported
  - Check that all Lucide React icons are available
  - Ensure no circular dependencies exist

  - _Requirements: 2.2_

- [ ] 7. Trigger new Vercel deployment
  - Make a small change or empty commit to trigger deployment
  - Push changes to GitHub
  - Monitor Vercel deployment logs in real-time
  - Wait for deployment to complete
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 4.1_

- [ ] 8. Test deployed application
  - Visit the Vercel URL and verify application loads
  - Navigate to /compare route and test functionality
  - Check browser console for any errors
  - Test 3D model loading and comparison features
  - Verify all interactive elements work correctly
  - _Requirements: 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [ ] 9. Document the fix and update deployment guide
  - Document the root cause of the issue
  - Update DEPLOYMENT.md with any new troubleshooting steps
  - Add notes about ComparePage deployment considerations
  - _Requirements: 4.1_
