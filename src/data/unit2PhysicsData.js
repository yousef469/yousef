      introduction: "Forces are pushes or pulls that cause objects to move, stop, or change direction. Understanding forces and motion is fundamental to engineering, especially in aerospace where we must calculate how forces affect aircraft. Newton's laws of motion explain how forces work.",

          title: "What is a Force?",
          content: `A force is a push or pull on an object:\n\n‚Ä¢ Measured in Newtons (N)\n‚Ä¢ Has magnitude (strength) and direction\n‚Ä¢ Can cause acceleration\n‚Ä¢ Can change shape\n\nExamples of Forces:\nüèÉ Push: Pushing a cart\nüé£ Pull: Pulling a rope\nüåç Gravity: Earth pulling objects down\nüß≤ Magnetic: Magnets attracting/repelling\n‚úàÔ∏è Thrust: Engine pushing aircraft forward\nüí® Drag: Air resistance slowing motion`
        },
        {
          title: "Newton's First Law (Inertia)",
          content: `"An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion, unless acted upon by a force."\n\nThis means:\n‚Ä¢ Objects resist changes in motion\n‚Ä¢ Need force to start moving\n‚Ä¢ Need force to stop moving\n‚Ä¢ Need force to change direction\n\nInertia = resistance to change in motion\n\nExample: In a car, you lurch forward when brakes are applied because your body wants to keep moving forward (inertia).`
        },
        {
          title: "Newton's Second Law (F = ma)",
          content: `"Force equals mass times acceleration"\n\nF = m √ó a\n\nWhere:\n‚Ä¢ F = Force (Newtons)\n‚Ä¢ m = mass (kilograms)\n‚Ä¢ a = acceleration (m/s¬≤)\n\nKey Points:\n‚Ä¢ More force = more acceleration\n‚Ä¢ More mass = less acceleration (for same force)\n‚Ä¢ Heavier objects need more force to accelerate\n\nExample: A small car accelerates faster than a truck with the same engine because it has less mass.`
        },
        {
          title: "Newton's Third Law (Action-Reaction)",
          content: `"For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction."\n\nMeaning:\n‚Ä¢ Forces always come in pairs\n‚Ä¢ Equal strength, opposite direction\n‚Ä¢ Act on different objects\n\nExamples:\nüöÄ Rocket: Exhaust pushes down, rocket pushes up\nüèä Swimming: Push water back, water pushes you forward\nüö∂ Walking: Push ground back, ground pushes you forward\n‚úàÔ∏è Jet Engine: Push air back, air pushes plane forward\n\nThis is how rockets work in space!`
