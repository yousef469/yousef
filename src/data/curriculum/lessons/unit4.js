  { id: 18, title: "Four Forces of Flight", unitNumber: 4, lessonNumber: 1, duration: "20 min", emoji: "‚úàÔ∏è",
    introduction: "Every aircraft in flight experiences four fundamental forces: lift, weight, thrust, and drag. Understanding these forces is essential to understanding how aircraft fly.",
    sections: [
      { title: "The Four Forces", content: "Lift: Upward force from wings\nWeight: Downward force from gravity\nThrust: Forward force from engines\nDrag: Backward force from air resistance\n\nFor steady flight, forces must balance!" },
      { title: "Force Balance", content: "Level Flight:\n‚Ä¢ Lift = Weight\n‚Ä¢ Thrust = Drag\n\nClimbing:\n‚Ä¢ Lift > Weight\n‚Ä¢ Thrust > Drag" }
    ],
    keyTakeaways: ["Four forces: lift, weight, thrust, drag", "Forces must balance for steady flight", "Changing forces changes flight path"],
    vocabulary: [{ term: "Lift", definition: "Upward force generated by wings" }, { term: "Drag", definition: "Air resistance opposing motion" }]
  },
  { id: 19, title: "Air Pressure and Bernoulli", unitNumber: 4, lessonNumber: 2, duration: "20 min", emoji: "üí®",
    introduction: "Wings create lift by manipulating air pressure. Bernoulli's principle explains how faster-moving air creates lower pressure.",
    sections: [
      { title: "Bernoulli's Principle", content: "Faster air = Lower pressure\nSlower air = Higher pressure\n\nWings are shaped so air moves faster over top, creating lower pressure above and higher pressure below = LIFT!" },
      { title: "Wing Shape", content: "Airfoil: Special wing shape\n‚Ä¢ Curved top surface\n‚Ä¢ Flatter bottom surface\n‚Ä¢ Air travels faster over top\n‚Ä¢ Pressure difference creates lift" }
    ],
    keyTakeaways: ["Bernoulli: faster air = lower pressure", "Wings create pressure difference", "Pressure difference generates lift"],
    vocabulary: [{ term: "Bernoulli's Principle", definition: "Faster fluid has lower pressure" }, { term: "Airfoil", definition: "Wing cross-section shape" }]
  },
  { id: 20, title: "Angle of Attack", unitNumber: 4, lessonNumber: 3, duration: "18 min", emoji: "üìê",
    introduction: "Angle of attack is the angle between the wing and oncoming air. It's one of the most important factors affecting lift.",
    sections: [
      { title: "What is AOA?", content: "Angle of Attack (AOA): Angle between wing chord line and relative wind\n\n‚Ä¢ Small AOA: Less lift\n‚Ä¢ Optimal AOA: Maximum lift\n‚Ä¢ Too large AOA: Stall!" },
      { title: "Stall", content: "Stall: When AOA is too large, airflow separates from wing\n‚Ä¢ Lift suddenly decreases\n‚Ä¢ Aircraft can't maintain altitude\n‚Ä¢ Pilots must reduce AOA to recover" }
    ],
    keyTakeaways: ["AOA affects lift generation", "Optimal AOA gives maximum lift", "Too large AOA causes stall"],
    vocabulary: [{ term: "Angle of Attack", definition: "Angle between wing and airflow" }, { term: "Stall", definition: "Loss of lift from excessive AOA" }]
  },
  { id: 21, title: "Thrust and Propulsion", unitNumber: 4, lessonNumber: 4, duration: "20 min", emoji: "üöÄ",
    introduction: "Thrust is the force that propels aircraft forward. Different types of engines produce thrust in different ways.",
    sections: [
      { title: "Types of Engines", content: "Propeller: Spins to push air backward\nJet Engine: Burns fuel to expel hot gases\nRocket: Carries own oxygen, works in space\n\nAll use Newton's 3rd Law: Push air back, aircraft moves forward!" },
      { title: "Thrust Requirements", content: "Takeoff: Need maximum thrust\nCruise: Moderate thrust to overcome drag\nClimb: Extra thrust to gain altitude" }
    ],
    keyTakeaways: ["Thrust propels aircraft forward", "Different engine types for different needs", "Thrust must overcome drag"],
    vocabulary: [{ term: "Thrust", definition: "Forward force from engines" }, { term: "Propulsion", definition: "System that generates thrust" }]
  },
  { id: 22, title: "Weight and Balance", unitNumber: 4, lessonNumber: 5, duration: "18 min", emoji: "‚öñÔ∏è",
    introduction: "Aircraft weight and balance are critical for safe flight. The center of gravity must be within limits.",
    sections: [
      { title: "Center of Gravity", content: "CG: Point where aircraft balances\n‚Ä¢ Too far forward: Nose-heavy, hard to lift\n‚Ä¢ Too far back: Tail-heavy, unstable\n‚Ä¢ Must be within limits!" },
      { title: "Weight Management", content: "Total Weight = Empty Weight + Fuel + Cargo + Passengers\n\nMore weight requires:\n‚Ä¢ More lift (higher speed or AOA)\n‚Ä¢ More thrust\n‚Ä¢ Longer runway" }
    ],
    keyTakeaways: ["CG must be within limits", "Weight affects performance", "Balance is critical for safety"],
    vocabulary: [{ term: "Center of Gravity", definition: "Point where aircraft balances" }, { term: "Weight", definition: "Downward force from gravity" }]
  },
  { id: 23, title: "Flight Envelope", unitNumber: 4, lessonNumber: 6, duration: "18 min", emoji: "üìä",
    introduction: "The flight envelope defines the safe operating limits of an aircraft. Pilots must stay within these limits.",
    sections: [
      { title: "Operating Limits", content: "Maximum Speed: Structural limit\nMinimum Speed: Stall speed\nMaximum Altitude: Engine/pressurization limit\nMaximum G-force: Structural limit" },
      { title: "V-Speeds", content: "Vs: Stall speed\nVr: Rotation speed (takeoff)\nVx: Best angle of climb\nVy: Best rate of climb\nVne: Never exceed speed" }
