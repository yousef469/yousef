          correctAnswer: 1,
          explanation: "Velocity includes both magnitude (speed) and direction, while speed only has magnitude.",

          correctAnswer: 1,

          question: "Acceleration can be negative.",

          question: "An object moving at constant velocity has zero acceleration.",
          correctAnswer: true,
          explanation: "If velocity is constant (not changing), acceleration is zero because acceleration is the rate of change of velocity.",
