# Lives/Hearts System Setup Guide

## âœ… What's Implemented

### Lives System Features:
- **Free Tier**: 5 lives, regenerate 1 every 5 hours
- **Starter Tier**: 10 lives, regenerate 1 every 5 hours  
- **Pro Tier**: Unlimited lives per month
- **Master Tier**: Unlimited lives forever

### How It Works:
1. User starts with 5 lives (free tier)
2. Each wrong answer in quiz/journey games costs 1 life
3. After 5 wrong answers, user loses all lives and must wait or upgrade
4. Lives regenerate automatically: 1 life every 5 hours
5. Full regeneration takes 20 hours (4 lives Ã— 5 hours)

## ðŸ”§ Setup Steps
