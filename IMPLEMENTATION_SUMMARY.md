## Files Created

1. **SUPABASE_GENERATIONS_TABLE.sql** - Database schema with cron functions
2. **src/contexts/GenerationsContext.jsx** - Generation tracking logic
3. **src/components/GenerationsDisplay.jsx** - UI component showing limits
4. **FREE_TIER_SETUP_GUIDE.md** - Complete setup instructions

## Files Updated

1. **src/components/AI3DGenerator.jsx** - Integrated generation checks
2. **src/main.jsx** - Added GenerationsProvider
3. **src/services/stripe.js** - Already had correct pricing

## Database Schema

```sql
user_generations table:
- user_id (UUID)
- tier (text)
- generations_used (int)
- daily_generations_used (int)
- max_generations (int)
- max_daily_generations (int)
- trial_start_date (timestamp)
- trial_end_date (timestamp)
- last_generation_date (date)
- last_reset_date (date)
```

## Automated Processes

### Daily Reset (Midnight UTC)
```sql
reset_daily_generations() - Resets daily_generations_used to 0
```

### Monthly Reset (1st of Month)
```sql
reset_monthly_generations() - Gives free users new 7-day trial
```

## User Flow

### New User Journey:
1. Signs up → Gets 7-day trial
2. Can generate 3 models/day
3. After 7 days → Trial expires
4. Must upgrade or wait until next month
5. On 1st of month → Gets new 7-day trial

### Paid User Journey:

3. No daily restrictions
4. Resets on 1st of each month

## UI Components

### GenerationsDisplay

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy Database Changes**
   - Run SUPABASE_GENERATIONS_TABLE.sql
   - Enable pg_cron extension
   - Set up cron jobs

2. **Deploy Frontend**
   - Already committed and pushed
   - Vercel will auto-deploy

3. **Test**
   - Create test account
   - Generate 3 models
   - Verify daily limit
   - Test trial expiration

4. **Monitor**
   - Track conversion rates
   - Monitor usage patterns
   - Adjust limits if needed

## Success Metrics
