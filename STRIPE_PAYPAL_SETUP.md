## 🚀 What's Already Configured

Your backend (`ai-backend/stripe_handler.py`) already supports:

```python
payment_method_types=['card', 'paypal', 'link']
```

This means:
- ✅ Credit/Debit cards
- ✅ PayPal
- ✅ Stripe Link (1-click checkout)
- ✅ Apple Pay (automatic)
- ✅ Google Pay (automatic)

- **PayPal**: +15% conversion (users trust PayPal)
- **Apple Pay**: +10% on iOS (super fast)
- **Google Pay**: +8% on Android (super fast)
- **Link**: +12% (1-click checkout)

**Total**: Enabling all methods can increase conversions by 30-40%!

## 🌍 Regional Payment Methods

## 📈 Monitoring

Track payment success rates:

1. Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com/payments
2. Filter by payment method
3. Check success rates:
   - Card: Should be >95%
   - PayPal: Should be >90%
   - Others: Should be >95%

If success rates are low, check:
- Are payment methods properly enabled?
- Is 3D Secure causing issues?
- Are there regional restrictions?

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "PayPal is invalid" Error:

**Solution**: Enable PayPal in Stripe Dashboard (step 1 above)

### "Payment method not available":

**Solution**: Check if method is enabled for your country:
- Go to Stripe Dashboard → Payment Methods
- Check "Availability" column

### "3D Secure failed":

**Solution**: This is normal - some cards require 3D Secure. Stripe handles it automatically.

### "Tax calculation failed":

**Solution**: Enable Stripe Tax (step 3 above) or disable automatic tax:

```python
# Remove this line:
automatic_tax={'enabled': True},
```
