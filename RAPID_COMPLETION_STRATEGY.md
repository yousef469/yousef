## ðŸŽ¯ Efficient Approach

### Option 1: AI-Assisted Batch Generation (Recommended)
**Time: 2-3 days**

1. **Use AI to generate lesson content**
   - Provide lesson titles and learning objectives
   - AI generates educational content
   - Review and refine
   - Add to data files

2. **Batch create quizzes**
   - 5 questions per lesson
   - Mix of multiple-choice and true/false
   - AI can generate based on content

3. **Test and deploy**
   - Quick testing of each lesson
   - Deploy incrementally

### Option 2: Simplified Content (Fastest)
**Time: 1-2 days**

1. **Create shorter lessons**
   - 2-3 sections instead of 4
   - Focus on core concepts
   - Can expand later

2. **Simpler quizzes**
   - 3-4 questions instead of 5
   - Multiple-choice only
   - Faster to create

3. **Launch MVP**
   - Get feedback from users
   - Improve based on usage

### Option 3: Phased Release
**Time: Ongoing**

1. **Launch with Units 1 & 4** (Already done!)
   - 12 lessons live
   - Start getting users
   - Gather feedback

2. **Add 1 unit per week**
   - Week 1: Unit 2 (Physics)
   - Week 2: Unit 3 (Math)
   - Week 3: Unit 5 (Components)
   - Week 4: Unit 6 (Materials)

3. **Benefits**
   - Launch faster
   - Iterate based on feedback
   - Maintain quality

## ðŸ’¡ My Recommendation
